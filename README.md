# Github-Issue-tracker (Android App)

This was done as part of a 3 hr coding excercise to demonstrate how to retrieve server data using web apis. Here, the task is to use the github web api to retrieve all open issues associated with the Rails organization's rails repository. 
1) Display list of issues with issue title and the issue details(140 characters). 
2) On tap on each issue, show associated comments with username.

Download the app from google drive.
