# Github-Issue-tracker
Github Issue tracker android app
This was done as part of a coding excercise. The task is to use the github web api to retrieve all open issues associated with the Rails organization's rails repository. Display list of issues and it's comments.
I would like to expand this app to search for any public github repo and look at the issues.
